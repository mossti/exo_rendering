## Milestones for Exoskeletal Arm Projects (Spring-Fall 2019) [MSR]

###NOTE: meeting alternating weeks w/ Dr. Huang

####continue reading papers
- haptic rendering
- exoskeletal research
- stroke survivor motor function
- human-in-the-loop control systems

####construct prototype
- CAD new/altered components
  - hex nut holder
  - spherical joints
- carbon fiber construction
- order fasteners
- order sensors
  - motor encoder
  - resistive force sensor
  - IMU/accelerometer
  - flex sensors (?)
- order soft material components
- order backpack for base (alternative?)
- plastic printing

####experiment with prototype
- modular weights
- modular sizing (adjustable for different bodies)
- incorporate soft material sheathes for grip
- incorporate soft material actuators
- incorporate cable components ('marionette')
- wear it! Considerations:
  - relatively inexpensive
  - low maintenance
  - accessible (minimal UI)
  - comfortable
  - effective rendering
    - high resolution
    - high sample rate
    - stable throughout arm's workspace
      - despite passing through unstable regions due to 'negative viscosity'

####matlab model
- familiarize self with model
- reflect experimental tweaks in model
  - i.e. for soft material, SOFA (?)
- optimize for desired motions
